Senior management at Indeed recognized a lack of alignment between the UX strategies of different product teams, By viewing adjacent Indeed products as separate, product teams risked creating a disjointed end-to-end user experience. To resolve this issue, they directed the Product Organization to create a unified framework for design, product management, and UX research, emphasizing the need to break down artificial boundaries between products to ensure a seamless user experience. I conducted foundational quantitative research and proof-of-concept development to initiate clickstream analytics research across all employer-facing products.</p>

<h2>What are Clickstream Analytics?</h2>

<p>
"The collection, analysis, and reporting of data detailing which website pages a user visits and is what order." - <a href src= "cxtoday.com">cxtoday.com</a>
"The recording of what a user click while browsing the web." - <a href src= "aunalytics.com">aunalytics.com</a>
