<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

I am  a quantitative social scientist currently exploring options for my next role. After completing my PhD Biological Anthropology at Penn State, I spent a year as a quantitative user experience researcher at Indeed Inc. My role was eliminted during a round of layoffs in March, and I've spent much of the time since working on skill development and some pet projects.
